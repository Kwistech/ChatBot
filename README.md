## Installation ##

+ Fork the repository and clone it to your local drive.

+ From the program's root directory, double-click `main.py`

## How to Use

Once the repository is cloned to your local drive, there are two variables you need to change.

1. Change the "channel" variable (found in main() function) to your Twitch channel's name (must be lowercase).
2. Change the "oauth" variable (also found in main() function) to your Twitch channel's OAuth key (can be generated [here](https://twitchapps.com/tmi/)).

Once the above two steps are done, all you have to do is run the script. The bot will be active when the message "ChatBot is now active." appears in the console/terminal.

To test if the bot is working, go to your Twitch channel and type a command associated with the bot (list of commands can be found in the commands.txt file.
